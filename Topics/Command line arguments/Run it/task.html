<h2>Run it</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Below is a module <code class="language-python">count_empty.py</code> that counts the number of empty strings in the given file, starting from the given line index.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys 

args = sys.argv 
if len(args) == 3:
    file_name = args[1]
    start = int(args[2])

    with open(file_name) as inp:
        counter = 0
        for i, line in enumerate(inp):
            if i &lt; start:
                continue
            if not line.strip():
                counter += 1

    print(counter)
else:
    print("The number of passed arguments is incorrect. ")</code></pre>
<p>How would you run it from the command line? Let's say you want to check the file <code class="language-python">test.txt</code> that is in the same directory as the script, and you want to start from the line with index<strong> 101</strong>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You don't need to look at the code in detail, you just need to understand what arguments the script takes.</p>
